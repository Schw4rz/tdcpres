# How We Met

### Contacts and coincidence

- I registered without a team, thus I needed to find motivated people

- Asked last year's winner and Munich Datageeks organizer Janek Thomas (<a href='https://twitter.com/thomasjanek'>@thomasjanek</a>, PhD student at LMU) at the September edition of Datageeks at Telefónica's headquarters if he wanted to participate

- Told me he will attend as speaker this year, but connected me with three master students in statistics at LMU that were already registered

- Met late in a bar with *Jann* and *Daniel* the Monday before the challenge and agreed on a basic approach, e.g. using the `R` ecosystem

- Team size was required to be four, so we grouped with *Moritz* (a physicist and data consultant, who registered individually) at the team building session at the event right before we got our hands on the data

# The Datathon: TEFDataChallenge

### Challenge on network outages with tree data science tasks

- Build a model to predict failures of network elements to prevent outages and save costs

- Create a nice visualization

- Come up with a creative story

### Real world data and problem in multiple data sets

- Basic data on network elements

- Historic data on unavailabilities of elements

- Data from the internal ticketing system describing problems

- Additional data from the ticketing system

---
# The Datathon: TEFDataChallenge

### Evaluation

- Kaggle like evaluation of predictive maintenance challenge, with aim to maximize complex savings function (in TEF Dollars: ₮):

$$max_{I} \sum_{1_I(ne)} (- C_M(\nu_{ne}) + \sum_{1_O(ne)}C_S(\delta_{ne}, \nu_{ne}))$$
- Variables:
    - $ne$: Single network element
    - $C_M$: Cost of maintenance (linear function)
    - $C_S$: Cost of outage, i.e. potential savings (linear function)
    - $1_I$: Indicator function if network element should be inspected (submitted as model output)
    - $1_O$: Indicator function if outage occours on network element
    - $\nu_{ne}$: Revenue of network element per hour (known)
    - $\delta_{ne}$: Duration of network element outage (unknown)

- Five minutes pitch to the Jury of six members from Telefónica and Wayra

# Takeaways, Learnings and Advice

# Advice for before the Datathon

### Preparation is important

- Get to know strengths of each team member and have all necessary skills in your team
    
- Think about a *basic* approach with all the info that is available beforehand (as much as is possible)

- Agree on programming language(s) and use only one language per separable problem (data processing, modelling, visualization)

- Update software and setup code and information sharing tools (github, slack, email, webserver, ...)

- Go to bed early, you won't have much time to sleep

---

# Takeaways from during the Datathon

### Be pragmatic, it's a hackathon!

- Listen carefully and read all hints of the organizers

- Make sure to understand the problem

- Don't start with coding too fast, spend time choosing the solution strategy

- Split work into chunks that can be done in parallel

- Start with something, improve it, don't focus on details first

- Don't give up if something is not working as expected -> breathe -> start all over

- Time is limited, use all of it -> sleep as little as necessary (or be efficient :D)

- Don't overfit the Public Leaderboard :D (thanks for the shock *DeepThought*)

---
# Advice for the pitch 

### The pitch

- Time limits are usually tough, don't waste time with introductions

- Present only what you think is interesting for the Jury so don't be too technical

- Present what you achieved, not what you experienced<sup>[1]</sup>

- Focus and present as many important parts as possible
